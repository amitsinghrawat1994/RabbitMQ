### Submit Order - Stock Shortage (Fails at Inventory)
# GUID ending in 0 is simulated as a failure in InventoryService/CheckInventoryConsumer.cs
# Note: You can't easily force a random Guid to end in '0' via .http file, 
# so you may need to use a specific Guid in the Controller if you want to test this via HTTP file easily.
# However, the current code generates a NEW Guid in the controller, so these will be random.
